Hey 👋🏽, there. Thanks for checkout this site. I like to muse about things I find interesting while building softwares, hiking or while on long drives.

I'm a Software Engineer, previously worked at Shopify, Inc. I love working on large scale projects, enjoy challenges of scale. I have mostly been building and shipping softwares for Apple platforms like iOS, macOS and now visionOS for a decade now. I'm always looking to find interesting projects to work on.  

Let's connect!
